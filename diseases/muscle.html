  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Muscle specialists are medical professionals who specialize in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and disorders of the muscular system. They play a crucial role in managing muscle health and promoting overall well-being. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in integrating Ayurvedic principles and practices into muscle care for a holistic approach.
  </p>

  <h2>Ayurveda and Muscle Health</h2>
  <p>
    Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, emphasizes a personalized and holistic approach to healthcare. It focuses on balancing the mind, body, and spirit to achieve optimal health. In the context of muscle health, Ayurveda identifies various factors that can contribute to muscular disorders, including imbalances in the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), improper diet, lifestyle choices, physical activity, and emotional disturbances.
