  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Respiratory specialists are medical professionals who specialize in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases and disorders of the respiratory system. They play a crucial role in managing respiratory health and promoting overall well-being. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in integrating Ayurvedic principles and practices into respiratory care for a holistic approach.
  </p>

  <h2>Ayurveda and Respiratory Health</h2>
  <p>
    Ayurveda, the ancient Indian system of medicine, emphasizes a personalized and holistic approach to healthcare. It focuses on balancing the mind, body, and spirit to achieve optimal health. In the context of respiratory health, Ayurveda identifies various factors that can contribute to respiratory disorders, including imbalances in the doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha), improper diet, lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and emotional disturbances.
